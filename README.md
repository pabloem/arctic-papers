## Dataset of Arctic-related papers
The dataset contains two main graphs:
* A bipartite graph of authors and papers
* A **tripartite** graph of authors, papers, and institutions. This is the main graph. To operate over 'pairs' of nodesets, it is only necessary to remove nodes of type 'paper', 'inst' or 'author'.
